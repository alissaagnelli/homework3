# Style and Customization

The style/customization is in the 'style.css' file. 

The background of the website is set to rgb(246, 236, 251). This is a very light purple shade. 

For the headers h1 and h2, the text color is set to rgb(60, 8, 62), has center alignment, and the font is Century Gothic. 

For h3, the text alignment and font is the same as the above two, but the color is set to rgb(126, 62, 128). 

Header h4 has the Futura font. The side margins are set to 6% side margins and the vertical are set to 2%.

For the four of these, as you go from h1 to h4, the font size gets smaller and smaller (40, 28, 20, and 16 px).

For paragraphs (p) have font Helvetica Neue so it is easily readable since this is the form that nearly all of the information is written in. The font size is 14 px. The margins are set to the same settings as header h4. The alignment is sent to "justify", since this will allow the text to look cleaner and more organized on the page.

For images, display is set to block and both the side margins are set to auto. These customizations will center the image on the page.

Unordered lists have a light green background (#eeffcc9f). The text color is set to a rgb(13, 63, 29), a dark green shade. This ensures the text is easy to read over the light green background. There is 10px padding puts more spacing in the list and improves the readability. The corner of the background is rounded through setting border radius to 10 px. The margins are set to 2% and 10%.
