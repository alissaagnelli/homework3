    <h1>The Danger of Puppy Mills and Backyard Breeders</h1>
    
    <h3>My name's Alissa, welcome to my website!</h3>

    <p>Throughout my entire life, I have always had dogs. All of my dogs have been rescues that 
        we fostered and adopted, so the topic of animal welfare is one I feel very 
        strongly about. I still volunteer at my local rescue shelter, as well!
    </p>
    <p>However, many of these rescue dogs come from places such as puppy mills and 
        backyward breeders. Dogs are forced to get pregnant over and over until they 
        no longer have the ability. These places then sell the puppies to make a profit, 
        at the expense of the innocent dogs held captive for breeding purposes. 
        Additionally, the puppies are often sick and have genetic issues, which can lead to a
        life of pain for the dog, and also expensive vet bills for the new owners. 
        Puppy mills and backyard breeders are notorious for their inhumane treatment of dogs,
        and the conditions they are kept in are horrific.

        The goal of my website is to further educate individuals on the unethical practices
        of puppy mills and backyard breeders. I also hope that through learning more about this
        topic, I can encourage more people to adopt their dogs from rescue shelters, as
        opposed to going to pet stores or breeders. These dogs need homes, and even 
        fostering them until they find their forever home is a great way to help!
